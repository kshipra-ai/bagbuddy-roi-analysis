# Investor ROI Metrics

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Return on Investment (ROI)
**Formula:** `((Current Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment) × 100`

Overall percentage return on the investment.

### 2. Annualized Return
**Formula:** `(((Current Value / Initial Investment)^(1/Years)) - 1) × 100`

Average annual return rate, accounting for the time period.

### 3. Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC)
**Formula:** `Current Value / Initial Investment`

How many times the initial investment has been returned.

### 4. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero.

### 5. Net Present Value (NPV)
**Formula:** `Sum of (Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Period)`

Present value of all future cash flows.

### 6. Profit Margin
**Formula:** `((Current Value - Initial Investment) / Current Value) × 100`

Percentage of current value that represents profit.

### 7. Payback Period
Time required to recover the initial investment.

### 8. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
**Formula:** `((Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years) - 1) × 100`
